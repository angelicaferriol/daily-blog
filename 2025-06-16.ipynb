    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Disk scheduling is how the **OS manages multiple I/O requests** to optimize performance (a.k.a. I/O scheduling).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiple processes = multiple disk I/O requests\n",
    "* **Disk arm moves slowly**; inefficient access = delays\n",
    "* Must **minimize movement**, wait time, and latency\n",

    "---\n",

    "| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n",
    "| **Seek Time**              | Time to move the disk arm to the correct track                     |\n",
    "| **Rotational Latency**     | Time for disk to rotate to desired sector                          |\n",
    "| **Transfer Time**          | Time to transfer data (based on speed & size)                      |\n",
    "| **Disk Access Time**       | `Seek Time + Rotational Delay + Controller Overhead + Queue Delay` |\n",

    "Each algorithm tries to reduce **Total Head Movement (THM)** — the sum of all arm movements between requests.\n",

    "### 1. **FCFS (First-Come First-Serve)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Easy but inefficient* – follows the **order of arrival**\n",
    "\n",
    "* No optimization → may jump wildly between tracks\n",
    "* Seek Time = THM × Seek Rate\n",
    "* **THM Example** = 640\n",
    "\n",
    "**Downside**: Long wait time and large arm movement\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Greedy strategy* – always services the **nearest request**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Minimizes **local seek time**\n",
    "* THM Example = 236\n",
    "* **Drawback**: Starvation (far tracks may be ignored)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Think: “Closest track gets served first, rest wait.”\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Like an elevator: goes one direction, serves all, then reverses\n",
    "\n",
    "* Covers **all requests in one direction** before turning back\n",
    "* Ensures fairness for all tracks\n",
    "* THM Example = 331\n",
    "\n",
    "> Use when you want equal chance for **all** disk locations\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **LOOK**\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimized SCAN – **only goes as far as needed**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Doesn’t go to the disk edge unless necessary\n",
    "* THM Example = 299\n",
    "* Slightly more efficient than SCAN\n",
    "\n",
    "> “LOOK before you sweep” – go *only* where requests exist\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Elevator resets to the start **without servicing** on return\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sweeps in one direction only\n",
    "* **Fair to new/far requests**\n",
    "* Resets like a typewriter (⟶ carriage return)\n",
    "* THM Example = 183 + α (return arm reset, usually ignored)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Good for *uniform wait time* but increases THM\n",
    "\n",

    "### 6. **C-LOOK**\n",
    "\n",
    "Like C-SCAN but avoids unnecessary arm movement\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stops at farthest request**, not end of disk\n",
