    "## **1. What Are Registers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Registers** are the fastest and smallest storage locations inside a CPU. They serve as temporary holding areas for data the processor is currently manipulating. Unlike memory (RAM), which is accessed relatively slowly, registers offer **near-instantaneous access**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the hierarchy of storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CPU Registers > Cache > RAM > Secondary Storage\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Registers are directly wired into the datapath of the processor, making them essential for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Holding operands during instruction execution\n",
    "* Storing intermediate results\n",
    "* Facilitating control flow and function calls\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of Registers**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **General-purpose registers (GPRs):** Hold operands and intermediate values.\n",
    "2. **Special-purpose registers:** Control execution and memory (e.g., Program Counter, Stack Pointer).\n",
    "3. **Floating-point registers:** Store real numbers (in processors with floating-point units).\n",
    "4. **Status or flag registers:** Track results of operations (e.g., zero flag, carry flag).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. What Are Operands?**\n",
    "\n",
    "An **operand** is the data operated upon by an instruction. It can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **register**\n",
    "* A **memory location**\n",
    "* An **immediate value** (constant)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the instruction `ADD R1, R2, R3`, the operands are `R2` and `R3` (sources), and `R1` is the destination.\n",

    "## **3. Registers and Operands in MIPS**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Register Naming and Usage**\n",
    "\n",
    "MIPS has **32 general-purpose registers**, each 32 bits wide. They are used symmetrically and are named both numerically and symbolically for clarity.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Register operands**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```assembly\n",
    "   add $t0, $t1, $t2    # $t0 = $t1 + $t2\n",

    "2. **Immediate operands**\n",

    "   addi $t0, $t1, 10    # $t0 = $t1 + 10\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Memory operands (load/store)**\n",
    "   MIPS is a **load-store architecture**, meaning arithmetic instructions **only operate on registers**, not directly on memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```assembly\n",
    "   lw $t0, 4($s1)       # Load word from memory[$s1 + 4] into $t0\n",
    "   sw $t2, 8($s3)       # Store $t2 into memory[$s3 + 8]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **MIPS Operand Restrictions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Operands must be registers or immediates.\n",
    "* No instructions like `add $t0, 4($t1), $t2` — memory must be accessed separately.\n",
