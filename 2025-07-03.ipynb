    "## I. What is Reinforcement Learning (RL)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement Learning** is a subset of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent aims to **maximize cumulative reward** through **trial-and-error** and **delayed feedback**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Key components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Agent:** The learner/decision maker (e.g., an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle - AUV)\n",
    "  * **Environment:** The marine world in which the agent operates (includes ocean currents, obstacles, seafloor, etc.)\n",
    "  * **State (s):** Representation of the agent’s current situation.\n",
    "  * **Action (a):** Possible moves the agent can take.\n",
    "  * **Reward (r):** Feedback signal (positive or negative).\n",
    "  * **Policy (π):** The agent’s strategy to choose actions based on states.\n",
    "  * **Value Function (V):** Expected reward for a state (or state-action pair).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## II. Why RL for Marine Robotics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Marine environments are **dynamic, unpredictable, and partially observable**, which makes **classical control systems** brittle. RL is well-suited to this domain because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It enables **adaptive decision-making** in uncertain environments.\n",
    "* It can optimize for **long-term objectives** (e.g., energy efficiency, mission success).\n",
    "* It allows robots to **learn behaviors** that are hard to hand-code.\n",

    "## IV. RL Algorithms Used in Marine Robotics\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Model-Free Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Q-learning / Deep Q-Networks (DQN):** Used in discrete action spaces.\n",
    "* **Policy Gradient / REINFORCE / PPO / A3C:** Suitable for continuous control like thruster actuation.\n",
    "* **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC):** High sample-efficiency and stability, works well with continuous action space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Model-Based Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn a **dynamics model** of the ocean/vehicle interaction.\n",
    "* Use **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** with learned models to plan.\n",
    "* Benefit: **Sample efficiency**, but suffer in **high-dimensional, noisy** marine environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Offline / Batch RL**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Useful in cases where **data collection is expensive**, such as deep-sea operations.\n",
    "* Trains using **pre-collected datasets**, avoiding costly and risky real-world interaction.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## V. Challenges in Marine RL\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Sparse and Delayed Rewards**\n",
    "\n",
    "* E.g., reaching a target location might take 100s of steps—slows learning.\n",
    "* Solution: Reward shaping, hierarchical RL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Partial Observability**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visibility is limited; sensors may be affected by turbidity or noise.\n",
    "* Solutions: Use **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** or **POMDP-based approaches**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Sample Efficiency**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Underwater experiments are expensive, time-consuming, and risky.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4. **Environmental Dynamics**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ocean conditions change rapidly; RL must adapt to **non-stationary environments**.\n",
    "* Meta-RL and continual learning approaches are promising.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Safety Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Crashing into coral reefs or surfacing too quickly is unacceptable.\n",
    "* Must integrate **safe RL** (e.g., with constrained optimization or shielding policies).\n",
