    "# Daily Blog #54 - Graph Theory: Finding Communities in Networks\n",
    "### June 23, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "> Graphs model real-world relationships — social networks, knowledge graphs, transportation routes, neural networks. Mastering them opens doors into **AI, data mining, optimization**, and research.\n",

    "### What is community detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a social network of friends. Communities (a.k.a. clusters) are groups where nodes (people) are densely connected to each other but sparsely connected outside the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import networkx as nx\n",
    "from networkx.algorithms import community\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Create a graph\n",
    "G = nx.karate_club_graph()  # famous social network dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Run a community detection algorithm\n",
    "communities = community.greedy_modularity_communities(G)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Print the detected communities\n",
    "for i, comm in enumerate(communities):\n",
    "    print(f\"Community {i+1}: {sorted(comm)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**This will give:**\n",
    "A partitioning of the graph into communities — you can analyze them as real-world social circles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to do next:\n",
    "\n",
    "Try different algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `asyn_fluidc` for asynchronous label propagation\n",
    "* `label_propagation_communities` for a simpler algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot the graph with different node colors for communities:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "color_map = {}\n",
    "for i, comm in enumerate(communities):\n",
    "    for node in comm:\n",
    "        color_map[node] = i\n",
    "\n",
    "colors = [color_map[node] for node in G.nodes()]\n",
    "nx.draw(G, node_color=colors, with_labels=True, cmap=plt.cm.tab10)\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters?**\n",
    "Community detection is at the heart of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understanding social networks\n",
    "* Fraud detection (finding suspicious clusters of accounts)\n",
    "* Product recommendation engines\n",
    "* Researching collaboration networks\n"
