    "## **1. What is Undecidability?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Turing Machines and formal languages, a decision problem is said to be **undecidable** if **no Turing Machine can be constructed that always gives a correct yes/no answer** (i.e., always halts) for **all possible inputs** to that problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Formal Definition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "A language **L** is undecidable if there does **not exist** any **Turing Machine M** such that for every input string **w**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If **w ∈ L**, M accepts w and halts.\n",
    "* If **w ∉ L**, M rejects w and halts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, **no algorithm can decide membership** in L for every possible input in a finite amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. What Is the Halting Problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Halting Problem** is the canonical example of an **undecidable problem**. It was first introduced by **Alan Turing in 1936** to demonstrate that there are limits to what can be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem Statement**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a Turing Machine **M** and an input string **w**, **does M halt on input w**, or does it loop forever?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Language Definition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\n",
    "**HALT = { ⟨M, w⟩ | M is a Turing Machine that halts on input w }**\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is whether there exists a Turing Machine **H** that, for every ⟨M, w⟩:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accepts if M halts on w.\n",
    "* Rejects if M does not halt on w.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: **No such machine H exists.**\n",
    "The Halting Problem is **undecidable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Turing’s Proof of Undecidability of the Halting Problem (Sketch)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Turing used **proof by contradiction**, constructing a paradox similar to the **liar paradox**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step-by-Step Idea**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assume** there exists a Turing Machine **H(M, w)** that decides whether M halts on input w.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Construct a new Turing Machine **D** that:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Takes input M.\n",
    "   * Uses H to determine if M halts when given its own description: H(M, M).\n",
    "   * If H says M halts on M → D loops forever.\n",
    "   * If H says M doesn’t halt on M → D halts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now, what happens when **D is run on its own description**, i.e., D(D)?\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to a contradiction:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If H(D, D) says D halts on D, then D loops forever.\n",
    "* If H(D, D) says D loops forever, then D halts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, such a Halting-decider H **cannot exist**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "| **Recognizable Language** | A TM exists that accepts all strings in L, but may loop on strings not in L. |\n",
    "| **Undecidable Language**  | No TM exists that halts on all inputs and correctly decides membership.      |\n",
    "\n",
    "**All decidable languages are recognizable**, but **not all recognizable languages are decidable**.\n",

    "## **5. Implications of the Halting Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Not every problem has an algorithmic solution**.\n",
    "* There are limits to computation—even with unlimited memory and time.\n",
    "* Software like antivirus tools or program verifiers **cannot be perfect**, because checking whether code will halt (or is safe) is inherently **undecidable** in general.\n",
    "* **Rice’s Theorem**, a generalization of the Halting Problem, states that **any non-trivial property** of the language recognized by a Turing Machine is **undecidable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Example of an Undecidable Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem**: Given a Turing Machine M, does M accept every input string?\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally:\n",
    "**ALL\\_TM = { ⟨M⟩ | M is a TM and L(M) = Σ* }*\\*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is undecidable, as it can be reduced from the Halting Problem. Knowing whether a machine accepts *every* string implies knowing whether it halts on all inputs—a problem proven unsolvable.\n",
