    "### What is Remote Sensing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote sensing is the science of obtaining information about objects or areas from a distance, typically using aircraft or satellites.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Measuring without touching.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Main Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Passive Remote Sensing**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Detects natural radiation (e.g., sunlight) reflected or emitted.\n",
    "   * Example: Optical sensors, thermal infrared.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Active Remote Sensing**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Emits its own signal and measures the return.\n",
    "   * Example: RADAR, LiDAR.\n",

    "## II. SATELLITE SYSTEMS\n",

    "### Satellite Orbits\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Geostationary (GEO)**: Always above the same spot; good for weather monitoring.\n",
    "* **Polar-Orbiting (LEO)**: Circles from pole to pole; better for high-resolution Earth observation.\n",
    "* **Sun-synchronous Orbit**: Passes over the same part of Earth at the same solar time every day.\n",
