    "# Daily Blog #82 - Context-Free Grammars (CFGs)\n",
    "### July 21, 2025 \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)** is a formal grammar that defines **context-free languages (CFLs)**. It is more expressive than regular grammars and is used to define the **syntactic structure of programming languages**, **mathematical expressions**, and **natural language fragments**. CFGs belong to **Type 2** in the **Chomsky hierarchy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Components of a CFG**\n",
    "\n",
    "A CFG is formally defined as a 4-tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "**G = (V, Σ, R, S)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **V** = a finite set of variables (non-terminal symbols)\n",
    "* **Σ** = a finite set of terminal symbols (input alphabet), disjoint from V\n",
    "* **R** = a finite set of production rules of the form **A → α**, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **A ∈ V**\n",
    "  * **α ∈ (V ∪ Σ)**\\* (i.e., α is a string of terminals and non-terminals)\n",
    "* **S ∈ V** is the start symbol\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Production Rules Format**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each production rule has a single non-terminal on the left-hand side and any string of terminals and/or non-terminals on the right-hand side:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **A → α**, where A is a non-terminal and α is a string from (V ∪ Σ)\\*\n",
    "\n",
    "This format means **rules can be applied regardless of context**, hence the term *context-free*.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Example of a CFG**\n",
    "\n",
    "**G = (V, Σ, R, S)**\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "\n",
    "* V = {S}\n",
    "* Σ = {a, b}\n",
    "* R = { S → aSb | ε }\n",
    "* S is the start symbol\n",
    "\n",
    "**Language generated**:\n",
    "All strings of the form **aⁿbⁿ**, where n ≥ 0 (equal number of a’s followed by b’s)\n",
    "Examples: ε, ab, aabb, aaabbb, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Derivations and Parse Trees**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **derivation** shows step-by-step replacements of non-terminals using production rules to produce a string.\n",
    "* A **parse tree** (or derivation tree) is a tree representation of the derivation, showing the hierarchical structure of the grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Derivations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Leftmost Derivation:** always expand the leftmost non-terminal first\n",
    "* **Rightmost Derivation:** always expand the rightmost non-terminal first\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ambiguity:**\n",
    "A grammar is **ambiguous** if there exists a string that has **more than one parse tree** or derivation. Ambiguity is problematic in compilers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "* Languages where dependency crosses (e.g., **aⁿbⁿcⁿ**) – requires **context-sensitive grammars**\n",
    "* Context-sensitive patterns that require more memory than a single stack (e.g., **equal numbers of a, b, and c in order**)\n",

    "  * A → ε (only if allowed)\n",
    "* **Greibach Normal Form (GNF):** All productions are of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A → aα (where a is a terminal and α is a string of non-terminals)\n",
