    "# Daily Blog #76 - Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)\n",
    "### July 15, 2025 \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. What is an NFA?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)** is a finite-state machine where, unlike a DFA, **multiple transitions** for the same input from the same state are allowed — including **transitions without consuming input** (ε-transitions).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "**DFA** = strict, one path only.\n",
    "**NFA** = chill, as many paths as it wants — as long as **at least one** accepts, the input is accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Formal Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "An NFA is defined by a 5-tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "**NFA = (Q, Σ, δ, q₀, F)** where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Q** = finite set of states\n",
    "* **Σ** = input alphabet\n",
    "* **δ** = transition function, δ: Q × (Σ ∪ {ε}) → 2^Q\n",
    "* **q₀** ∈ Q = start state\n",
    "* **F** ⊆ Q = set of accepting/final states\n",
    "\n",
    "Key difference:\n",
    "δ now returns **a set of possible states**, not just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Core Characteristics**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multiple possible transitions** for a single input from a state.\n",
    "* Can have **ε-transitions** (move without consuming input).\n",
    "* Accepts a string if **at least one** path leads to an accepting state.\n",
    "* **More expressive-looking**, but **no more powerful** than DFAs in terms of what they can recognize (both accept **regular languages**).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. DFA vs. NFA: Summary Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature              | DFA                          | NFA                                  |\n",
    "| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |\n",
    "| Transition per input | Exactly one                  | Zero, one, or many                   |\n",
    "| ε-transitions        | Not allowed                  | Allowed                              |\n",
    "| Processing           | Single path                  | Multiple possible paths              |\n",
    "| Acceptance           | All input must lead to final | At least one path must lead to final |\n",

    "#### **5. Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Language**: Strings over Σ = {a, b} ending with \"ab\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NFA Construction:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **q0**: start state\n",
    "* **q1**: saw ‘a’\n",
    "* **q2**: saw ‘a’ then ‘b’ (accepting)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transitions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* δ(q0, a) = {q0, q1}\n",
    "* δ(q0, b) = {q0}\n",
    "* δ(q1, b) = {q2}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final State**: q2\n",
    "This NFA accepts any string ending in \"ab\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how:\n",
    "\n",
    "* From q0 on ‘a’, we can either stay in q0 or go to q1.\n",
    "* It’s nondeterministic because it branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. How Does an NFA Process Input?**\n",
    "\n",
    "For input string `w`, NFA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Starts at **q₀**\n",
    "2. Follows **all possible paths** in parallel (conceptually)\n",
    "3. If **any** path ends in a final state **after consuming the full input**, it **accepts** `w`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you think in code: use **depth-first** or **breadth-first search** through states for each input.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **7. Power & Equivalence**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every NFA has an **equivalent DFA**. But the DFA might have **up to 2ⁿ states** (n = NFA states).\n",
    "* NFAs are generally **easier to design** due to flexibility.\n",
    "* DFAs are better for **implementation** due to simplicity and predictability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **8. NFA with ε-Transitions (ε-NFA)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some NFAs include transitions that require **no input symbol** to move to another state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* δ(q0, ε) = {q1, q2}\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "* From q0, the machine can jump to q1 or q2 **without reading any input**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simpler construction\n",
    "* Useful when converting regex to automata\n",

    "Accepting state: q2\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Input: `1001` → q0→q0→q1→q2 → accepted\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Problem 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Design an ε-NFA that accepts strings where the third symbol from the end is **a** over Σ = {a, b}.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We need to look ahead 3 symbols and check the third last is **a**.\n",
    "* Let the NFA guess when it's 3 symbols from the end using ε-transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**States**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* q0: start\n",
    "* q1: guessed we're 3 symbols from end\n",
    "* q2: read 2 more symbols\n",
    "* q3: accepting\n",

    "* δ(q0, b) = {q0}\n",
    "* δ(q0, ε) = {q1}\n",
    "* δ(q1, a) = {q2}\n",
    "* δ(q1, b) = ∅\n",
    "* δ(q2, a) = {q3}\n",
    "* δ(q2, b) = {q3}\n",
    "\n",
    "q3 = final state\n",
    "\n",
    "This machine nondeterministically guesses that the current symbol is third from the end and checks if it’s **a**, then reads two more symbols and accepts.\n",

    "\n",
    "### PRACTICE PLAN\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convert Regex to ε-NFA**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Learn Thompson’s construction.\n",
    "   * Practice with patterns like `(a|b)*abb`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simulate NFAs by hand**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * For short strings, follow **all paths** manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Master NFA → DFA conversion**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Subset construction algorithm\n",
    "   * Practice converting 3-state NFAs to DFA and minimize the result\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Understand ε-closure**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Critical when dealing with ε-NFAs\n",
    "   * ε-closure(q) = set of states reachable from q by ε-moves only\n"
