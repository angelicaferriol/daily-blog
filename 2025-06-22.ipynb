    "# Daily Blog #53 - Tools & Techniques for Correlation and Relationship Analysis\n",
    "### June 22, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog, we will explore *how to examine relationships between variables*. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation Matrix & Heatmap \n",
    "When working with multiple numeric variables, you want a quick overview of which variables move together — this is where a **correlation matrix** comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technicals:\n",
    "* `df.corr()` — computes pairwise Pearson correlations for all numeric columns.\n",
    "* `sns.heatmap()` — visualizes the resulting correlations in a color-coded grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning:\n",
    "* Quickly identify **which variables have strong positive or negative relationships**.\n",
    "* Save time by deciding which pairs to explore further.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bivariate Plots with Regression Lines \n",
    "Numbers alone can hide patterns or nonlinear behavior. Plotting lets you see what’s going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technicals:\n",
    "* `sns.lmplot()` — scatter plot with optional regression fit, allowing you to check **linearity and trends**.\n",
    "* Adjust parameters (`height`, `aspect`, `scatter_kws`, `line_kws`) to improve clarity and highlight relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning:\n",
    "* Visually confirm whether a **linear model** is a good fit.\n",
    "* Spot **outliers**, **clusters**, or unexpected shapes that might require further data cleaning or different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Tests for Correlation \n",
    "Plotting is powerful but subjective. Statistical tests give you a **formal measure** of strength and significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technicals:\n",
    "* `scipy.stats.pearsonr()` — tests for **linear correlation** and returns both the **correlation coefficient (r)** and the **p-value**.\n",
    "* `scipy.stats.spearmanr()` — tests for **monotonic relationships** (not necessarily linear) using ranked data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning:\n",
    "* **r-value** tells you *how strong and in what direction* the relationship is.\n",
    "* **p-value** tells you whether this relationship is **unlikely due to random chance** (typically significant if `p < 0.05`).\n",
    "* Use Spearman if data is **not normally distributed** or the relationship looks nonlinear.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "By combining:\n",
    "* **Heatmaps** for quick overview,\n",
    "* **Scatter plots** for visual insight,\n",
    "* **Pearson/Spearman tests** for rigorous confirmation,\n",
    "you’ll have a **complete toolkit** for understanding relationships between any two variables."
