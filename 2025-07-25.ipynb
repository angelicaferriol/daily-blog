    "## **1. Introduction to Turing Machine (TM)**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Turing Machine (TM)** is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine capable of simulating any algorithm. Proposed by **Alan Turing** in 1936, the TM is foundational in theoretical computer science because it captures the concept of **what it means to compute** something.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TM is **more powerful** than finite automata (FA) and pushdown automata (PDA) because it has **unlimited memory** and can perform **arbitrary computations**, including those requiring recursion, loops, and conditional logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Significance of the Turing Machine**\n",
    "\n",
    "* It serves as a **universal model of computation**.\n",
    "* TMs are used to define **decidability** and **computability**.\n",
    "* The **Church-Turing Thesis** posits that any problem that can be computed by any mechanical process can be computed by a Turing Machine.\n",
    "* Turing Machines can simulate any algorithm written in a programming language, making them equivalent to modern computers in theoretical power (though not in practicality or speed).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Formal Definition of a Turing Machine**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Turing Machine** is a 7-tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "**M = (Q, Σ, Γ, δ, q₀, B, F)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Q**: finite set of states\n",
    "* **Σ**: input alphabet (does not include the blank symbol)\n",
    "* **Γ**: tape alphabet (includes all symbols that can appear on the tape, including the blank symbol)\n",
    "* **δ**: transition function, defined as\n",
    "  δ: Q × Γ → Q × Γ × {L, R}\n",
    "* **q₀** ∈ Q: initial state\n",
    "* **B** ∈ Γ: blank symbol\n",
    "* **F** ⊆ Q: set of final (accepting) states\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Tape and Head**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **tape**, divided into infinite cells (to the right and potentially to the left), acts as the machine's memory.\n",
    "* A **head** reads and writes symbols on the tape and can move **left (L)** or **right (R)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. How a Turing Machine Operates**\n",
    "\n",
    "At any step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The TM reads the symbol under the head.\n",
    "2. Based on the current state and symbol read, the machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Writes a new symbol (or the same symbol) on the tape.\n",
    "   * Moves the head left or right.\n",
    "   * Transitions to a new state.\n",
    "3. The machine **halts** when it enters a final (accepting or rejecting) state or if there is no applicable transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple mechanism allows the Turing Machine to perform complex computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Turing Machine Example 1: Unary Addition**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Design a TM that adds two unary numbers (represented as sequences of 1s) separated by a **0**.\n",
    "Example: Input `111011` → Output `11111`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Language**: L = { 1ⁿ01ᵐ | n, m ≥ 1 }\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Replace the separator `0` with a `1` to merge the two unary sequences.\n",
    "* Move right until the `0`, change it to `1`, and then halt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **States**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **q₀**: Start state, scan to find the separator `0`\n",
    "* **q₁**: Overwrite `0` with `1` and move to halt\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Transitions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* δ(q₀, 1) → (q₀, 1, R)\n",
    "* δ(q₀, 0) → (q₁, 1, R)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tape Movement Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Input: `111011`\n",
    "* Step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * q₀ reads 1 → move R\n",
    "  * q₀ reads 1 → move R\n",
    "  * q₀ reads 1 → move R\n",
    "  * q₀ reads 0 → write 1, move R → go to q₁\n",
    "  * TM halts in q₁\n",
    "* Output: `111111`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Turing Machine Example 2: Palindrome Checker (for even-length binary palindromes)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Design a TM to check if a string over {0,1} is a **palindrome** (same forward and backward), for even-length strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Language**: L = { wwᴿ | w ∈ {0,1}⁺ }\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Idea**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mark the first and last matching symbols.\n",
    "* Recurse inward.\n",
    "* If mismatch → reject. If all match → accept.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Strategy**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Replace the first 0 with `X`, scan right to find the last 0 and replace it with `X`.\n",
    "* Same for 1 with `Y`.\n",
    "* Repeat this process inward.\n",
    "* Accept if all are marked and no mismatch found.\n",
    "\n",
    "This TM is significantly more complex but showcases the expressive power of Turing Machines to handle symmetry and recursion.\n",

    "\n",

    "## **10. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Turing Machine is the cornerstone of modern computational theory. Unlike finite automata and pushdown automata, which are limited to regular and context-free languages respectively, the TM captures **all effectively computable functions**. Though not practical for implementation, the Turing Machine remains the ultimate theoretical model for understanding what can and cannot be computed by machines.\n"
