    "# Daily Blog #67 - Class Imbalance + SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)\n",
    "### July 6, 2025 \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification, **imbalanced data** means some classes appear much more frequently than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Class                      | Count  |\n",
    "| -------------------------- | ------ |\n",
    "| Legitimate Transaction (0) | 98,000 |\n",
    "| Fraudulent Transaction (1) | 2,000  |\n",
    "\n",
    "A model can be **98% accurate by doing nothing but predicting 'legit'**â€”completely useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It's a Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bias toward the majority class**: Most models are optimized for overall accuracy, not minority class precision.\n",
    "* Metrics like **accuracy become meaningless**.\n",
    "* Class 1 (minority) is often the one we care about most (fraud, cancer, failure, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fixes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Use Better Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Precision**: How many predicted positives are *actually* positive.\n",
    "* **Recall**: How many actual positives are *correctly* predicted.\n",
    "* **F1 Score**: Balance between precision and recall.\n",
    "* **AUC-ROC / PR Curve**: Good for binary classification imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Resampling Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. **Undersampling**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remove random majority class samples to balance dataset.\n",
    "* Risk: You throw away potentially useful data.\n",
    "* Use when you have too much majority data and speed matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. **Oversampling (Naive)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Duplicate minority class instances.\n",
    "* Risk: Overfitting to repeated examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. **SMOTE** \n",
    "\n",
    "## SMOTE: Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "**SMOTE generates synthetic examples** of the minority class, interpolating between real samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works (Simplified):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick a minority class sample.\n",
    "2. Find its **k nearest minority class neighbors**.\n",
    "3. Choose one neighbor at random.\n",
    "4. Create a synthetic point *between the two* in feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use SMOTE?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Continuous variables\n",
    "* Not great for categorical data alone (but there's SMOTENC for that!)\n",
    "* Combine with **Tomek Links** or **Edited Nearest Neighbors** to clean noisy samples (SMOTE + Tomek is strong in practice).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Example in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import classification_report\n",
    "from collections import Counter\n",
    "\n",
    "# X = features, y = labels\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, stratify=y, test_size=0.3)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Before SMOTE:\", Counter(y_train))\n",
    "\n",
    "smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)\n",
    "X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"After SMOTE:\", Counter(y_resampled))\n",
    "\n",
    "clf = RandomForestClassifier()\n",
    "clf.fit(X_resampled, y_resampled)\n",
    "y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pro Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Always apply SMOTE *after* train-test split**. Never oversample before splitting.\n",
    "* Use **pipeline + cross-validation** to avoid leakage.\n",
    "* Check **ROC and PR curves**, not just accuracy.\n",
    "* Try **ensemble methods with balanced class weights** (like `class_weight='balanced'` in `LogisticRegression` or `RandomForestClassifier`).\n"
