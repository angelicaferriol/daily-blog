    "## **1. Introduction to Assembly Language**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assembly language** is a low-level programming language that provides a symbolic representation of a computer’s machine code instructions. Each assembly instruction corresponds to a single operation executed by the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assembly is architecture-specific, meaning the syntax and instruction sets vary between processors. The two most common architectures for educational and practical use are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages):** A RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture, known for its simplicity and regular syntax.\n",
    "* **x86:** A CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture, used in Intel and AMD processors, known for its irregular syntax and widespread real-world use.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. General Structure of an Assembly Instruction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical format for an assembly instruction is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[label:] instruction operand1, operand2, operand3 ; comment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Label:** (optional) A symbolic name for a memory location or instruction address.\n",
    "* **Instruction:** The operation to perform (e.g., `add`, `mov`, `load`).\n",
    "* **Operands:** Registers, memory addresses, or immediate values.\n",
    "* **Comment:** (optional) Begins with a symbol (`#` in MIPS, `;` in x86) and explains the line.\n",

    "## **3. MIPS Assembly Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **a. Register Naming**\n",
    "\n",
    "MIPS uses **32 general-purpose registers** named both numerically and symbolically:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Register  | Name                | Usage                  |\n",

    "### **b. Common Instruction Formats**\n",
    "\n",
    "MIPS instructions are **fixed-length (32-bit)** and follow strict formats. Key examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **R-Type (Register)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Used for arithmetic and logic operations.\n",

    "and $a0, $a1, $a2    # bitwise AND\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **I-Type (Immediate)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Used for instructions with constants or memory operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "addi $t0, $t1, 10    # $t0 = $t1 + 10\n",
    "lw   $t0, 4($s0)     # load word from memory[$s0 + 4] into $t0\n",
    "sw   $t0, 4($s0)     # store word from $t0 into memory[$s0 + 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **J-Type (Jump)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Used for control flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "j   label            # jump to label\n",
    "jal func             # jump and link (for procedure calls)\n",
    "jr  $ra              # jump to return address (function return)\n",
