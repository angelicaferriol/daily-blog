    "### **Part 1: Network Layer and Routing Fundamentals**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section covers the OSI Network Layer, router operations, IP protocol characteristics, and basic router configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1 The OSI Network Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "The network layer, or OSI Layer 3, provides services to allow end devices to exchange data across a network. Its primary services are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Addressing:** Provides end devices with a unique network identifier, such as an IP address.\n",
    "- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulates the transport layer Protocol Data Unit (PDU) into a packet, adding a Layer 3 header with source and destination IP addresses.\n",
    "- **Routing:** Directs packets toward the destination host. Routers use the destination IP address to make forwarding decisions.\n",
    "- **De-encapsulation:** At the destination host, the Layer 3 header is removed, and the Layer 4 PDU is passed up to the transport layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2 Router Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Packet Forwarding:** Routers use the **destination IP address** in a packet's header to determine the best path to forward the packet. When multiple routes to a destination exist, the router chooses the path with the **lower metric value**.\n",
    "- **Routing Table:** A router maintains a routing table to make forwarding decisions. Key entries include:\n",
    "    - **Directly-connected routes:** These are networks directly attached to one of the router's interfaces. They do not have a next-hop address.\n",
    "    - **Remote routes:** These are networks that are not directly connected. These entries will have a next-hop IP address, which is the address of the next router to send the packet to.\n",
    "    - **Default Route:** Also known as the gateway of last resort, it's used when there is no specific route for a destination network in the routing table.\n",
    "- **Packet Processing:** When a router receives a frame, it performs the following steps:\n",
    "    1. De-encapsulates the Layer 2 frame to expose the Layer 3 packet.\n",
    "    2. Examines the destination IP address of the packet.\n",
    "    3. Looks up the destination network in its routing table to find the exit interface.\n",
    "    4. Creates a new Layer 2 Ethernet frame for the outgoing interface and forwards the packet.\n",
    "- **Host Routing:** A host also has its own local routing table. This table typically contains:\n",
    "    - A route to the loopback interface (`127.0.0.1`).\n",
    "    - A route to its local network.\n",
    "    - A remote default route, which points to its default gateway for all remote traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.3 The IP Protocol**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Internet Protocol (IP) is the primary Layer 3 protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "    - **Connectionless:** IP does not establish a connection with the destination before sending packets.\n",
    "    - **Best-Effort (Unreliable):** IP does not guarantee packet delivery. It doesn't perform error control for out-of-order or missing packets.\n",
    "    - **Media Independent:** IP can operate over different types of network media.\n",
    "- **Reliance on Other Layers:** IP relies on upper-layer services, like TCP, to handle reliability, error control, and sequencing. It also relies on Layer 2 protocols for transmission error control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.4 IPv4 and IPv6 Headers**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key IPv4 Header Fields:**\n",
    "    - **Version:** A 4-bit field set to `0100` for IPv4.\n",
    "    - **Time-to-Live (TTL):** An 8-bit field that limits the lifetime of a packet. Each router that processes the packet decrements the TTL by one. If it reaches zero, the packet is discarded.\n",
    "    - **Protocol:** An 8-bit field that identifies the upper-layer protocol being carried (e.g., TCP is 6, UDP is 17).\n",
    "    - **Source IPv4 Address:** The 32-bit address of the sending device.\n",
    "    - **Destination IPv4 Address:** The 32-bit address of the receiving device.\n",
    "    - **Header Checksum:** Used to detect corruption in the IPv4 header.\n",
    "- **IPv6 Advantages:**\n",
    "    - **Larger Address Space:** The vast number of available public IPv6 addresses eliminates the need for Network Address Translation (NAT).\n",
    "    - **Simplified Header:** The IPv6 header is simpler, leading to more **efficient packet handling**. It removes the checksum field, relying on other layers for error checking.\n",
    "    - **Flow Label:** A field that can be used to inform routers to maintain the same path for packets in the same real-time application stream (e.g., video, audio).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.5 Basic Device Configuration & Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Router Boot Process:**\n",
    "    1. Perform the POST (Power-On Self-Test) and load the bootstrap program.\n",
    "    2. Locate and load the Cisco IOS software.\n",
    "    3. Locate and load the startup configuration file from NVRAM. If no startup-config is found, the router enters setup mode.\n",
    "- **Memory Types:**\n",
    "    - **NVRAM (Non-Volatile RAM):** Stores the startup configuration file. Its contents are retained when power is removed.\n",
    "    - **RAM:** Stores the running configuration file.\n",
    "    - The `copy running-config startup-config` command saves the current configuration from RAM to NVRAM.\n",
    "- **Default Gateway on a Switch:** A switch is a Layer 2 device, but it can be configured with an IP address and a default gateway. The `ip default-gateway` command is used to allow the switch to be remotely managed from a host on another network. It does **not** provide routing services for PCs connected to the switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 2: IP Addressing and Subnetting**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section explores IPv4 subnetting, address types, and the fundamentals of IPv6 addressing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 IPv4 Subnetting**\n",
    "\n",
    "Subnetting divides a larger network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prefix Notation:** The subnet mask can be represented by a prefix length, which is the number of `1`s in the mask. For example, `255.255.255.224` in binary is `11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000`, which has 27 ones, so its prefix is `/27`.\n",
    "- **Calculating Hosts:** The number of usable host addresses in a subnet is calculated with the formula `$2^h - 2$`, where `$h$` is the number of host bits.\n",
    "    - A `/26` mask has `$32 - 26 = 6$` host bits. This provides `$2^6 - 2 = 64 - 2 = 62$` valid host addresses.\n",
    "- **Calculating Subnets:** To determine how many subnets can be created, use the formula `$2^n$`, where `$n$` is the number of bits borrowed from the host portion. To create 4 subnetworks from a `/24` network, you need to borrow 2 bits (`$2^2 = 4$`), making the new mask `/26`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 IPv4 Address Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Private Addresses (RFC 1918):** These addresses are not routable on the public internet and are reserved for use in internal networks. The ranges are:\n",
    "    - `$10.0.0.0 /8$` (10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255)\n",
    "    - `$172.16.0.0 /12$` (172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255)\n",
    "    - `$192.168.0.0 /16$` (192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255)\n",
    "- **Public Addresses:** Globally routed addresses. Any address not in the private, loopback, or other reserved ranges is a public address.\n",
    "- **Loopback Address:** `$127.0.0.1$` is a special address used to ping the local TCP/IP stack to verify it is functioning correctly.\n",
    "- **Link-Local Addresses (APIPA):** In the `$169.254.0.0/16$` range. These are automatically assigned by an OS when a device cannot contact a DHCP server.\n",
    "- **Broadcast Messages:**\n",
    "    - **Limited Broadcast (`255.255.255.255`):** Sent to all hosts on the *local* network.\n",
    "    - **Directed Broadcast:** Sent to all hosts on a specific *remote* network.\n",
    "- **Multicast Addresses:** The Class D range `$224.0.0.0$` to `$239.255.255.255$` is reserved for multicast traffic, sent to a specific group of subscribing hosts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3 IPv6 Addressing**\n",
    "\n",
    "IPv6 uses a 128-bit address, providing a massive address space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Address Compression Rules:**\n",
    "    1. Omit leading zeros in any 16-bit hextet.\n",
    "    2. Use a double colon (`::`) to replace one contiguous string of all-zero hextets. This can only be used once per address.\n",
    "    - Example: `2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:a0b0:0008:0001` compresses to `2001:db8::a0b0:8:1`.\n",
    "- **IPv6 Unicast Address Types:**\n",
    "    - **Global Unicast (GUA):** Publicly routable addresses, similar to public IPv4 addresses.\n",
    "    - **Link-Local Unicast (LLA):** Automatically configured on every IPv6-enabled interface. They are in the `$FE80::/10$` range and are used for communication between devices on the same link. They are not routable.\n",
    "    - **Loopback:** The address `::1` is the IPv6 loopback address.\n",
    "- **IPv6 Multicast Addresses:**\n",
    "    - `$FF02::1$`: All-nodes multicast address. Packets sent here are received by all IPv6-enabled devices on the local link.\n",
    "    - `$FF02::2$`: All-routers multicast address.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Address Assignment:**\n",
    "    - **SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration):** Allows a host to create its own GUA by using ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages to learn the network prefix.\n",
    "    - **DHCPv6 (Stateful/Stateless):** A server-based method for address assignment.\n",
    "- **Interface ID Creation (EUI-64):** An interface ID can be created from the 48-bit MAC address of the interface by inserting `FF:FE` in the middle of the MAC address.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 3: Transport and Application Layers**\n",

    "    - **Ordered Delivery:** Uses **sequence numbers** to reassemble segments in the correct order.\n",
    "    - **Flow Control:** Uses **window size** to manage the amount of data sent before requiring an acknowledgment. The window size is determined by how much data the destination can process at one time.\n",
    "- **Session Establishment (3-Way Handshake):**\n",
    "    1. The client sends a `SYN` (Synchronize) segment to the server.\n",
    "    2. The server replies with a `SYN-ACK` (Synchronize-Acknowledge) segment.\n",
    "    3. The client sends an `ACK` (Acknowledge) segment back to the server.\n",
    "- **Session Termination:**\n",
    "    1. Client sends `FIN` (Finish).\n",
    "    2. Server sends `ACK`.\n",
    "    3. Server sends `FIN`.\n",
    "    4. Client sends `ACK`.\n",
    "- **TCP Header:** Includes fields for Sequence Number, Acknowledgment Number, Window Size, and Control Bits (flags like `SYN`, `ACK`, `FIN`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.3 UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**\n",
    "\n",
    "UDP is a simple, connectionless protocol that provides basic transport functions with low overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Features:**\n",
    "    - **Connectionless:** No handshake is performed. It just sends the datagrams.\n",
    "    - **Unreliable:** No acknowledgments, sequencing, or flow control.\n",
    "    - **Fast:** Low overhead makes it suitable for applications that are delay-sensitive.\n",
    "- **Best for:**\n",
    "    - Applications that can tolerate some data loss but require little delay (e.g., VoIP, video streaming).\n",
    "    - Applications that handle reliability themselves.\n",
    "- **UDP Header:** Contains only Source Port, Destination Port, Length, and Checksum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.4 Port Numbers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Port numbers are used to identify the source and destination applications or processes.\n",

    "- **Dynamic/Private Ports (49152-65535):** Used as temporary source ports by clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.5 Application Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "The application layer of the TCP/IP model provides the interface between applications and the network. It performs the functions of the OSI Application, Presentation, and Session layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Network Models:**\n",
    "    - **Client/Server:** A dedicated server provides services (e.g., file storage, web hosting) to clients. A workstation making a DNS request is an example.\n",
    "    - **Peer-to-Peer (P2P):** Devices can act as both clients and servers, sharing resources without a dedicated server. P2P applications include BitTorrent and Gnutella.\n",
    "- **Key Protocols:**\n",
    "    - **DNS (Domain Name System):** Resolves domain names to IP addresses. It uses UDP for client queries and TCP for server-to-server zone transfers. An MX record maps a domain name to a mail exchange server.\n",
    "    - **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** Automatically assigns IP addresses and other configuration to hosts. The process is Discover (client broadcast), Offer (server unicast), Request, Acknowledge.\n",

    "### **Part 4: Network Security and Troubleshooting**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section covers common network threats, security best practices, and essential troubleshooting commands and methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.1 Network Security Threats**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Types of Attacks:**\n",
    "    - **Reconnaissance:** An attacker gathers information about a network to find vulnerabilities, often using tools like `nslookup` and `fping`.\n",
    "    - **Access Attacks:** An attempt to gain unauthorized access, such as cracking a password.\n",
    "    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.\n",
    "    - **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** An attacker intercepts communication between two endpoints.\n",
    "- **Malicious Code (Malware):**\n",
    "    - **Virus:** Attaches to a legitimate program and requires user intervention to spread.\n",
    "    - **Worm:** Self-replicates and spreads automatically by exploiting vulnerabilities. The most effective mitigation is to download security updates and patch all systems.\n",
    "    - **Trojan Horse:** Malicious code disguised as a legitimate application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.2 Security Mitigation Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AAA Security:**\n",
    "    - **Authentication:** Requires users to prove their identity (e.g., with a password).\n",
    "    - **Authorization:** Determines what resources an authenticated user can access.\n",
    "    - **Accounting:** Tracks the actions of a user.\n",
    "- **Firewalls:** A component designed to protect against unauthorized communications. Firewall filtering types include:\n",
    "    - **Packet Filtering:** Based on source/destination IP or MAC addresses.\n",
    "    - **Application Filtering:** Based on source/destination port numbers.\n",
    "    - **URL Filtering:** Based on web addresses or keywords.\n",
    "    - **Stateful Packet Inspection:** Ensures incoming traffic is a legitimate response to requests from internal hosts.\n",
    "- **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System):** A dedicated device that detects and blocks attacks in real-time.\n",
    "- **Secure Management:**\n",
    "    - **SSH (Secure Shell):** Provides a secure (encrypted) remote management connection, making it superior to Telnet, which sends data in plaintext.\n",
    "    - **SSH Configuration Steps:**\n",
    "        1. Configure a unique hostname.\n",
    "        2. Configure an IP domain name (`ip domain-name <domain>`).\n",
    "        3. Create a local user database (`username <name> secret <password>`).\n",
    "        4. Generate RSA keys (`crypto key generate rsa`).\n",
    "        5. Configure VTY lines for SSH (`line vty 0 4`, `login local`, `transport input ssh`).\n",
    "- **Password Security:**\n",
    "    - **Strong Passwords:** Use a mix of upper/lower case letters, numbers, and special characters, with a length of at least 10. Avoid dictionary words or personal information.\n",
    "    - **Weak Passwords:** Easily guessable words (`password`), default passwords (`admin`), number sequences (`12345678!`), or personal info (`Feb121978`).\n",
    "    - **Mitigating Attacks:** Use the `login block-for <seconds> attempts <num> within <seconds>` command to thwart brute-force password attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.3 Network Troubleshooting Methodology**\n",

    "    - An **extended ping** (issued without a destination IP on a router) allows specifying parameters like the source IP address.\n",
    "- **`tracert` (Windows) / `traceroute` (IOS):** Identifies the path a packet takes, showing each hop. It's useful for locating where a packet was lost or delayed.\n",
    "    - The `6` option in Windows forces the trace to use IPv6.\n",
    "- **`ipconfig` (Windows):** Displays the IP configuration of a PC, including IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.\n",
