    "## **1. Overview of Control Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "Control flow determines the sequence in which instructions are executed in a program. In high-level languages, it’s managed using `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `switch`, etc. In assembly language, this control is implemented explicitly using **branching**, **jump**, and **loop instructions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These instructions modify the **Program Counter (PC)**, which stores the address of the next instruction to execute. By changing the PC, the CPU can **repeat** code blocks (loops), **skip** them (conditional branches), or **jump** to subroutines or labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Branching in MIPS**\n",
    "\n",
    "MIPS assembly uses **conditional** and **unconditional** branches. MIPS relies heavily on **register comparisons** and **label-based destinations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1. Unconditional Jump**\n",
    "\n",
    "```assembly\n",
    "j label          # Jump to the instruction at 'label'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2. Conditional Branches**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Instruction        | Description                       |\n",
    "| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |\n",
    "| `beq`              | Branch if equal                   |\n",
    "| `bne`              | Branch if not equal               |\n",
    "| `blt`, `bgt`, etc. | Not in basic MIPS, must use `slt` |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3. Using `slt` for Comparisons**\n",
    "\n",
    "MIPS does not have high-level comparisons like `<`, `>`, etc. It uses `slt` (set on less than), which sets a register to `1` if a condition is true, and `0` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```assembly\n",
    "slt $t0, $s1, $s2      # $t0 = 1 if $s1 < $s2\n",
    "bne $t0, $zero, label  # Branch if $s1 < $s2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## **3. Loops in MIPS**\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are constructed by combining conditional branches and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1. While Loop Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```assembly\n",
    "# while ($t0 < 10) { ... }\n",
    "li $t1, 10          # Set loop limit\n",
    "loop_start:\n",
    "  slt $t2, $t0, $t1     # if $t0 < 10\n",
    "  beq $t2, $zero, end   # break if false\n",
    "  # loop body\n",
    "  addi $t0, $t0, 1      # increment counter\n",
    "  j loop_start\n",
    "end:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.2. For Loop Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```assembly\n",
    "# for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)\n",
    "li $t0, 0          # i = 0\n",
    "li $t1, 5          # limit\n",
    "loop:\n",
    "  bge $t0, $t1, exit\n",
    "  # loop body\n",
    "  addi $t0, $t0, 1\n",
    "  j loop\n",
    "exit:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: `bge` is a pseudo-instruction and internally uses `slt` or similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Branching in x86 (Intel Syntax)**\n",
    "\n",
    "x86 uses a **flags-based** approach. Comparisons affect status flags in the **EFLAGS** register, which are then used by conditional jump instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.1. Unconditional Jump**\n",
    "\n",
    "```assembly\n",
    "JMP label        ; Unconditionally jump to label\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.2. Comparison and Conditional Jumps**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `CMP` or `TEST` to set flags\n",
    "* Use `Jxx` instructions to branch based on those flags\n",
    "\n",
    "| Instruction   | Condition Checked              |\n",
    "| ------------- | ------------------------------ |\n",
    "| `JE` / `JZ`   | Equal / Zero                   |\n",

    "```assembly\n",
    "CMP EAX, EBX     ; Compare EAX and EBX\n",
    "JE equal_label   ; Jump if EAX == EBX\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Loops in x86**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways to build loops in x86:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5.1. Manual Counter Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "```assembly\n",
    "MOV ECX, 5        ; Set counter\n",
    "loop_start:\n",
    "  ; loop body\n",
    "  DEC ECX\n",
    "  JNZ loop_start  ; Jump if ECX != 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`JNZ` uses the Zero Flag (ZF), which is cleared if the result of `DEC` is not zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5.2. While Loop Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```assembly\n",
    "MOV EAX, 0        ; i = 0\n",
    "MOV EBX, 10       ; limit\n",
    "\n",
    "loop_check:\n",
    "  CMP EAX, EBX\n",
    "  JGE loop_end\n",
    "  ; loop body\n",
    "  INC EAX\n",
    "  JMP loop_check\n",
    "loop_end:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5.3. For Loop Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```assembly\n",
    "MOV ECX, 5\n",
    "FOR_LOOP:\n",
    "  ; loop body\n",
    "  LOOP FOR_LOOP    ; Decrement ECX and jump if ECX != 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LOOP` instruction is a shorthand, but it's less commonly used in modern compilers due to its inefficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Branch Delay Slots (MIPS Specific)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In older MIPS architectures, a **branch delay slot** executes the instruction **immediately following** a branch or jump **before** the branch takes effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "```assembly\n",
    "beq $t0, $t1, label\n",
    "addi $s0, $s0, 1      # Executed even if branch is taken\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern MIPS pipelines may handle this differently (or the assembler will fill the slot).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7. Practical Uses of Branching**\n",
    "\n",
    "Branching is used to implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Conditionals (`if`, `else if`, `else`)\n",
    "* Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)\n",
    "* Function returns\n",
    "* Error checking and program control\n",
    "* Jump tables and switch-case constructs\n",
    "\n",
    "In optimized code, **loop unrolling**, **branch prediction**, and **reordering** are used to improve performance.\n",
