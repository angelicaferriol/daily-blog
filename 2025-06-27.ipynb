    "# Daily Blog #58 - All About Computational Thinking\n",
    "### June 27, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### WHAT IS COMPUTATIONAL THINKING (CT)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational Thinking** is *not* programming. It's a *problem-solving mindset* that uses principles from computer science to tackle complex issues efficiently and systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's how software engineers, data scientists, and AI researchers *think* before they code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### CORE COMPONENTS OF CT\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of CT as having **4 Pillars**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Decomposition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Break a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Think: Divide and Conquer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Building an e-commerce app? Break it into:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Product display\n",
    "* User authentication\n",
    "* Cart functionality\n",
    "* Payment gateway\n",
    "* Admin panel\n",
    "\n",
    "Without decomposition, you're just swimming in chaos.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Pattern Recognition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Find similarities or trends across problems or datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Think: Why reinvent the wheel?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Recognize that login forms follow similar structures—username, password, validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Data Science:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recognize recurring trends in datasets (e.g., seasonal sales, anomalies).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Abstraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignore unnecessary details. Focus on what matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Think: Build a model, not a messy reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "When simulating traffic, you don’t model every crack on the road. You abstract cars as objects with position and velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, `functions` and `classes` are abstraction tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Algorithm Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create step-by-step solutions or rules to solve each problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Think: Logic before syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Designing an algorithm for sorting data, pathfinding, or validating form inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A good algorithm =**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clear logic\n",
    "* Efficient (time & space)\n",
    "* Handles edge cases\n",
    "\n",
