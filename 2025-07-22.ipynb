    "# Daily Blog #83 - Parse Trees and Derivations in Context-Free Grammars\n",
    "### July 22, 2025 \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the study of **Context-Free Grammars (CFGs)**, two fundamental tools used to analyze the structure of generated strings are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Derivations**: Step-by-step applications of production rules to generate strings.\n",
    "* **Parse Trees** (also called **Derivation Trees**): Hierarchical, tree-like visual representations of derivations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are used to validate whether a string belongs to a language generated by a grammar, and they help reveal ambiguities, nested structures, and the underlying syntax of expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Derivations**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **derivation** is a sequence of rule applications starting from the start symbol that produces a terminal string.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two standard types:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **a. Leftmost Derivation (LMD)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Always expands the **leftmost** non-terminal first at every step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **b. Rightmost Derivation (RMD)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Always expands the **rightmost** non-terminal first at every step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example Grammar:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let G be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **S → aSb | ab**\n",
    "\n",
    "This grammar generates strings like: `ab`, `aabb`, `aaabbb`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example Derivations for `aabb`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leftmost Derivation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. S\n",
    "2. → aSb\n",
    "3. → aaSbb\n",
    "4. → aa**b**bb (S → ab)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rightmost Derivation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. S\n",
    "2. → aSb\n",
    "3. → aSbb\n",
    "4. → aabb (S → ab)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both derivations result in the same string (`aabb`), but the order in which non-terminals are replaced differs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Parse Trees**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **parse tree** is a tree diagram that represents the **syntactic structure** of a string derived from a CFG. Each **interior node** is a non-terminal, and each **leaf node** is a terminal (or ε if applicable).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Properties:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Root node is the **start symbol**.\n",
    "* Internal nodes are **non-terminals**.\n",
    "* Leaves are **terminals** or **ε**.\n",
    "* Children of a node correspond to symbols on the right-hand side of a production used for that non-terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Parse Tree for `aabb` Using the Grammar Above:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "        S\n",
    "      / | \\\n",
    "     a  S  b\n",
    "        /|\\\n",
    "       a S b\n",
    "          |\n",
    "          b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This corresponds to the derivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* S → aSb\n",
    "* → aaSbb\n",
    "* → aabb\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Ambiguity in Grammars**\n",
    "\n",
    "A CFG is **ambiguous** if there exists a string in its language that has **more than one distinct parse tree** (or more than one leftmost/rightmost derivation).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Ambiguous Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Grammar:\n",
    "\n",
    "* E → E + E | E \\* E | (E) | id\n",
    "\n",
    "String: `id + id * id`\n",
    "\n",
    "This string has **two parse trees**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *(id + id) \\* id* — implies addition happens first\n",
    "2. *id + (id \\* id)* — implies multiplication happens first\n",
    "\n",
    "This ambiguity is problematic in compilers and must be resolved through grammar rewriting or precedence rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
