    "# Daily Blog #57 - Merge Sort, Bcrypt, and Boyer–Moore\n",
    "### June 26, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Merge Sort\n",
    "**Merge Sort** is a classic **sorting algorithm** that follows the **divide-and-conquer** paradigm. It breaks a list into halves, sorts each half, and then merges them back together.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works:\n",
    "1. **Divide** the list into two roughly equal halves.\n",
    "2. **Sort** each half **recursively**.\n",
    "3. **Merge** the two sorted halves into a single sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Complexity:\n",
    "* Best, average, and worst case: **O(n log n)** — highly efficient for large datasets.\n",
    "* **Space complexity**: Requires extra memory to hold sublists.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Input: `[8, 3, 5, 1, 7]`\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Split into `[8, 3]` and `[5, 1, 7]`.\n",
    "* Recursively sort each sub-array.\n",
    "* Merge into `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Bcrypt\n",
    "**Bcrypt** is a **password hashing algorithm** that enhances security. It applies multiple rounds of hashing to a password and includes a unique random **salt** for every password.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works:\n",
    "1. Generate a **salt** — a random string that is combined with the password.\n",
    "2. Apply the **Blowfish-based** hashing algorithm multiple times.\n",
    "3. Store the resulting hash and salt together.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Complexity:\n",
    "* Adjusted by the **cost factor** (2^cost rounds).\n",
    "  More rounds = slower hash, making brute force attacks impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Password: \"AgriPass123\"\n",
    "Salt: \"$2b$10$XmvsPwmRYh.eVwPMlKUqCe\"\n",
    "Resulting hash: \"$2b$10$XmvsPwmRYh.eVwPMlKUqCeQ8ZXc5mZK6VbL1eMfZ9o3iy5jb7cguK\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Boyer–Moore\n",
    "**Boyer–Moore** is an **efficient string-searching algorithm** that looks for a pattern within a larger text. Unlike simpler algorithms, it can **skip characters** intelligently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works:\n",
    "* **Preprocessing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Bad character table**: If a mismatch is found, jump past the last occurrence of that character.\n",
    "  * **Good suffix table**: Aligns the matched suffix with another occurrence in the pattern.\n",
    "* **Search**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Scan the pattern **right-to-left**.\n",
    "  * On mismatch, use the precomputed tables to jump further.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Complexity:\n",
    "* **Average**: \\~**O(n)** — very fast.\n",
    "* **Worst**: O(n\\*m), where n is text length and m is pattern length.\n",
    "* **Space complexity**: O(m + |Σ|), where Σ is the alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Text: `\"fresh green cabbage\"`\n",
    "Pattern: `\"cabbage\"`\n",
    "Boyer–Moore jumps past irrelevant characters quickly instead of checking every character one by one."
