    "\n",
    "**Geospatial data** = data that has a **location** tied to it (latitude, longitude, depth, etc.). In marine contexts, this could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Coral reef locations\n",
    "* Sea surface temperature at specific points\n",
    "* Pollution concentration near coastlines\n",
    "* GPS tracking of marine animals or fishing vessels\n",

    "import geopandas as gpd\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import contextily as ctx\n",

    "mpas = gpd.read_file(\"philippines_marine_protected_areas.geojson\")\n",

    "```python\n",
    "mpas = mpas.to_crs(epsg=3857)  # convert to Web Mercator for basemaps\n",
    "ax = mpas.plot(figsize=(10, 10), alpha=0.5, edgecolor='black')\n",

    "\n",
    "* Spatial join: Show which coral reefs fall inside or outside protected zones\n",
    "* Use a CSV of marine data points and convert them into a GeoDataFrame for mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load and clip a satellite `.tif` raster (e.g., chlorophyll)\n",
    "* Combine it with reef shapefiles to study correlation between chlorophyll and reef health\n",
