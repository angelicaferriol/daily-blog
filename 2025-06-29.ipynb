    "## 1. **What is Time Series Forecasting?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **time series** is a sequence of data points collected over time intervals (e.g., hourly, daily, monthly).\n",
    "**Time series forecasting** is the use of models to predict future values based on previously observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples in Oceanography:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Forecasting **sea surface temperatures (SST)** to detect El NiÃ±o.\n",
    "* Predicting **chlorophyll concentration** to monitor algal blooms.\n",
    "* Estimating **tidal patterns** or **wave heights** for coastal safety.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ocean data is messy. Hereâ€™s a practical workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handle **missing values**: forward fill, interpolation, seasonal fill.\n",
    "* Remove outliers (e.g., via IQR or Z-score).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resampling\n",
    "\n",
    "* Aggregate or interpolate to uniform intervals (e.g., daily mean SST).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stationarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Check and correct for **non-stationarity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **ADF Test** or **KPSS Test**.\n",
    "* Apply differencing or transformations (log, Box-Cox).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lag features** (previous observations).\n",
    "* **Rolling means** (e.g., 7-day average).\n",
    "* **Seasonal indicators** (month, day of year).\n",
