    "### What a P-Value Means:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A p-value is the **probability of obtaining a result as extreme as the observed one**, *assuming the null hypothesis is true*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "**P(Data | H₀)**\n",
    "Not\n",
    "**P(H₀ | Data)** ← This is what most people *think* it is (but it’s Bayesian logic, not frequentist).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Structure of a Hypothesis Test:\n",
    "| Step                                 | Description                                                                   |\n",
    "| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **1. Null Hypothesis (H₀)**          | No effect or no difference (e.g., “There is no change in GPA after tutoring”) |\n",
    "| **2. Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**   | There *is* an effect (e.g., “Tutoring increases GPA”)                         |\n",
    "| **3. Choose α (Significance Level)** | Common: 0.05                                                                  |\n",
    "| **4. Run test → get p-value**        | t-test, ANOVA, chi-squared, etc.                                              |\n",
    "| **5. Compare p-value to α**          | If p < α → reject H₀. Otherwise, fail to reject.                              |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Need to Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **p < 0.05** = statistically significant → evidence *against* the null\n",
    "* **p > 0.05** ≠ proof that H₀ is true → it just means you don’t have strong evidence to reject it\n",
    "* A p-value is **not** the probability your hypothesis is true\n",
    "* **Small p ≠ big effect** — it just means the effect is unlikely under the null\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effect Size vs. P-Value:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric                           | What It Tells You                             |\n",
    "| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **P-value**                      | Is there *statistical* evidence of an effect? |\n",
    "| **Effect size** (e.g. Cohen’s d) | How *large* is that effect?                   |\n",
    "| **Confidence Interval**          | How *precise* is the estimate of the effect?  |\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **all three**, not just the p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Mistakes to Avoid:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Running 20 tests and reporting only the one with p < 0.05 = **p-hacking**\n",
    "* Confusing correlation with causation\n",
    "* Ignoring context: A tiny p-value in a massive sample might mean nothing practically\n",
