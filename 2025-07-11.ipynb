    "### I. What Is Systems Thinking?\n",
    "\n",
    "Systems thinking is a way to analyze **complex, interconnected problems** by understanding **how the parts influence each other** within the whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s used in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Climate modeling\n",
    "* Organizational strategy\n",
    "* Engineering failures\n",
    "* AI safety\n",
    "* Public policy\n",
    "* Personal productivity (yes, even your messed-up sleep schedule)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### II. Key Concepts (Rapid-Fire)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Concept               | What It Means                                  | Example                                                           |\n",
    "| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **Feedback Loop**     | Output affects future input                    | Working late → sleep late → tired → work slower → work late again |\n",
    "| **Stocks & Flows**    | Stocks = stored things, Flows = rate of change | Weight = stock; calories = flow                                   |\n",
    "| **Leverage Point**    | Small change = big impact                      | Changing your *environment* vs. forcing willpower                 |\n",
    "| **Delayed Effect**    | Consequences show up later                     | Overfishing → collapse decades later                              |\n",
    "| **System Archetypes** | Patterns in systems                            | \"Fixes that fail,\" \"Shifting the burden,\" etc.                    |\n",

    "### III. How You’re Probably Solving Problems Wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people:\n",
    "\n",
    "* See a fire \n",
    "* Put out the fire \n",
    "* Ignore why it keeps coming back \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Symptom: “I can’t stay consistent.”\n",
    "> Fix: “Let me make a new Notion tracker.”\n",
    "> Real root: “Your reward system is broken, and you’re running on short-term dopamine loops.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### IV. Example: Burnout in Students (System Map Sketch)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pressure → Overwork → Fatigue → Lower productivity → Guilt → Even more overwork\n",
    "* Feedback loop keeps spiraling\n",
    "* **Leverage point?** Break the guilt cycle, not just the schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### V. Applying Systems Thinking in Real Life\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Map the system.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Draw arrows. Use causal loops. Understand how X → Y → Z.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Find feedback loops.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Is this problem **reinforcing itself**? Is there a delay?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Find leverage points.**\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s the *one thing* that, if you changed it, would cause the system to behave better?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Stop fighting symptoms.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Track problems *back to structure*, not circumstance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### VI. Final Hit List of Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fix procrastination (by understanding motivation systems)\n",
    "* Scale a business (by modeling operations as systems)\n",
    "* Lead better teams (by managing team dynamics as feedback loops)\n",
    "* Build better AI (by understanding training loops and reward systems)\n",
    "* Heal broken habits (by redesigning your reward structures)"
